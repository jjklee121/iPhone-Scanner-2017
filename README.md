Original credit goes to https://github.com/insanoid/Apple-Store-Reserve-Monitor for the stock checking functionality

Added in PushBullet notification for devices when stock is found
You need to add in your PushBullet key in the config
Also you will need to run `pip install pushbullet.py` in addition to the below steps

For the config settings for stores and iPhone models remove the stores and models to show everything.
This will give you the store/model codes you need to filter down by. 

# Apple Store Reserve Monitor
### Supports iPhone 8 and iPhone X

A simple script to monitor status of the iPhone availability in a given country. Can be changed to any country, device type, and to filter by specific models/carriers/stores. Makes an audio announcement if there is a change in the stock for given configuration. 

### Config.json

The configuration file has the following variables:

1. *country_code* - ISO code for country (2 character) *(required)*
2. *device_family* - `iphone8`, `iphone7`, `iphonex` - should be possible for any other family names. *(required)*
3. *zip_code* - ZIP code to search for (e.g. 90210) *(required)*
4. *models* - List the models you are interested about, it does a partial match so country specific information can be stripped (`MQ8J2LL/A`, `MQ8J2`) default value is all the models.
5. *carriers* - Carriers you are interested in. US carriers - `TMOBILE/US`, `SPRINT/US`, `ATT/US`, `VERIZON/US`, `UNLOCKED/US`. If you are outside US just do not put this in.
6. *stores* - ID of the stores you are interested in (you will have to run the script once to get the store ID), default value is all the stores in that region.

**To get store's ID, and model number, carrier names you will have to run the script once.**

##How To Run:
-  Ensure you have Python 3.5.4 and run `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
-  Execute `./storecheck.py` to run once.
-  Execute `./monitor_run_me.py` to keep running it every 30 seconds.
